    <h3>Thoughts i needed to share</h3>
    <div class="sub">I'm sorry there are no fucking breaks in between but if u get lost that's your problem</div> 

    <div class="warn">I dont even know why i'm making a website for this or maybe i want to send it to you, idk i feel like u wouldn't wanna see this or 
        maybe I shouldnt show this to you <br><br> 
        but if you're seeing this that's bc I fucking suck, no I actually made this so i can send it to you but yet again maybe I'm scared <br><br>
        I made this whole thing so I can hear myself and write my thoughts out somewhere, well you wont be there to aruge with me anyways lmao <br><br>
        Lmao I just think if i put this on a website maybe I can show it to you if I want or maybe I can make it a little more pretty, 
        also bc i had written 10000 characters long and i couldnt actually put this elsewhere.
    </div> 
    <hr>

    <p>We actually had smtg back then but then u had to fucking go ahead and ruin it sure fucking blame it on me bc i forced you to do stuff u never wanted to do, yeah bc finding a new guy is more easier than talking to me about it or talking me thru it. I fucking hate how easily you could just find someone like it ughh, but damn i didn't remember why I was so fucking mad at you for leaving but then i realised why when I was reading your chats, last yr we were literally like dating bitch, idc what the fuck you thought it was but we fucking liked each other and acted like couples that's pretty much fucking dating like we didn't had to be explicitly exclusively, we both liked each other so much then yes you would tell me I ruined it all by fucking Asking you for stuff, ik you didn't like to communicate but like I didn't even know you would actually just think it's better to leave than just fucking talk to me, or did you just thought that im not even worth the talk? There is no fucking way in hell if u actually liked me you would have left me without even trying. Don't you fucking dare say that you tried in the past, saying you don't like sending them is different from saying i don't want to send them to you. Like I fucking thought I was special and like idk you didn't really 
        complain about it a lot either, did u even actually leave me bc of that or is it because you realised Arjun would be better bc well as you said you would give me up for someone who's in-person. But when u asked me that Rish i actually fucking thought 'man i would actually think about her before doing smtg like that'. Ok ik you would think it sounds fucking stupid and it's embarrassing to admit,  like I wouldn't sure as hell wouldn't fucking pick you over anyone now,  but back then i actually loved you, i don't fucking care if i didn't express it or gave you mixed signals. I loved you and i thought I was expressing it as much as I could. You just thought I was trying to fill in a void of me not having a gf? Honestly I thought you're like my gf in some capacity, like ik we can't be physical nor can I be with you but I still liked you, I hope u understood that? I mean I sure as hell wouldn't have fucking went ahead and fucked another girl that's fs. Oh it's not even that, the fact that you thought I don't even deserve a fucking goodbye like what did i even mean to you Mehrish? That's what bothered me the most when u left, 
        you went ahead and did exactly what Sana did but even worse than her, i liked you, and i was stupid enough to think that was mutual, sure you would argue it was the case but don't you fucking dare say that after what you pulled, I hated you like literally fucking hated you, even worse than Sana bc u were dating another guy, I only cared about Sana bc she thought he was better than me lmaooo so funny and I've never experienced anything like that before and u knew that. You knew how much that affected me and how I took it, but you didn't even fucking care about all that and just did smtg worse than that. You decided to leave me blinded not knowing what I did wrong nor what went wrong, hell I had to find out about your boyfriend from your story like everyone else lmao. Ik you liked your bf and u didn't wanna hurt him and he made you think about marriage and having a fucking future with him, idc be happy be fucking happier but i think we spent way too much time together to just block me without notice, I mean sure you ghosted me when you were mad or dazzled by your bf or whatever the fuck u were, but you didn't even carr to explain yourself 
        before even hitting that block button, idk Rish i just think it's funny that how you could come back again to block me but not tell me what's going on, like a simple fucking 'hey i have a boyfriend now, fuck off' would have sufficed, but no oh no no no we had to ghost him and block him but fuck him who cares about what he thinks, right? I actually don't get it Rish, why would u decide to come back again after the break up, like what the fuck do u think would happen, oh yes you wanted to talk to me all those time u were in a relationship and never wanted to stop talking to me and he was scared you'll meet me when you come to Chennai like boo fucking hoo, you're not even the same, i could fucking see that and you make up pretty good excuses for them I mean sure they're true and not excuses ik, but that doesn't mean I'm okay with it, like idk what you think, you texted me right after your break up like I'm your safety net or smtg then i thought 'oooh maybe she wants things like to be like before'? Then you fucking kissed another guy after like three days??? That fucking broke me like sure u didn't like it and isn't gonna lead anywhere but Rish that does not make it any fucking better. I don't like that you seem distant now, I don't like you just text me whenever 
        you're bored and whenever I'm convenient bc hey I have no shame and no fucking self respect oooh and nothing to do at all other than wait for your texts right? Like pfft what else am I gonna do other than thinking about you all day and making up cute scenarios in my head oh and which you will call me a loser for later oh but ig that's just a joke huh? haha ig I'm a loser for trusting you and loving you. I don't want to be something you could pick up whenever you want so u can get validation and attention so u could boost your ego bc I don't require much right? One text and I'll be spamming your ass with fuck ton of shit that you won't even bother looking at, Rish i honestly don't know why I still have hope, I can't believe i actually suffer from FOMO when it comes to you and my god the crumbs of attention and validation you give me is enough to keep this whole thing intact? I lost my trust in you when I saw your story with another guy after you ghosted me, I still don't trust you and i don't wanna stay long enough witness what else you would do in your life, and yes it fucking makes me jealous so much i hate it, it just makes it look like you don't care, ik we'll never be the same as we were one year back but atleast I wish some part of you would remember it and treat me with some dignity. Idk why I hoped i could actually get back to that old us lmao fuck I was so stupid ughhh, when you text me ig it just sparked a hope in me but then i just thought I was  a safety net which I felt actually okay with bc i just idk maybe we could still be like old times, but actually this just feels worse than the time when we first met, I guess i still likes you and it's making me sick, sick of fucking hoping you would give me attention like throwing a bone to a dog every day after you eat your meal, you'll sure as hell eat the meal and the dog would get the bone, that would happen everyday but it's just not enough for a dog to suffice, idk what the fuck I'm saying i hate you, i feel so disgusted of myself that i don't actually mean it when I used actually to hate you. I'm just so craved for attention and yours especially, I ignore everyone else's, i just want yours, ik that makes u feel so giggly and boost your ego even more but Rish I just feel bad for you even after all that that makes u giggle, lmao if that is if u ever get to read this. Honestly don't even feel special i felt the same way about a lotta people's attention. But I'm just scared of letting you go. You've been with me for so long, you're the only person that is still in my life that has been with me that long, leaving you feels like leaving behind a whole section of myself behind, 
        man I feel so fucking stupid for even feeling these ways while you're just so nonchalant about me and kissing other guys idk, you'll surely think I'm a loser that just makes me feel so fucking disgusting That you don't even feel the same way that I do, oh and you're going to clg oh I do not want to stick around with you to find out what the fuck you're gonna do over there with guys, your school was not even coed yet u sucked a lotta dicks, i don't even wanna know what you're gonna do when you're in clg, idk ig ignorance is bliss lmao. I hate that you actually thought I won't stand up for myself when you literally told me I'm easy to text bc i don't hurt your ego. You just make me feel gross inside everyday and you make me hate myself for liking you each day even after the shit that you do, Rish honestly ik you would tell me something to deny all of these but please just don't, I'm always sick of hearing you say meaningful excuses that tie up perfectly, you're just shit, and you absolutely treated me like shit. Yes you think I'm shit and I'm fucking loser, but then why fucking use me for attention and validation. And why the fuck do i please you everytime, you just make me hate myself Rish and i really really made up my mind when you left me for another guy, but your text made me feel so fucking happy that i forgot. Idk Rish I feel like you've just changed and that's good for you or maybe u deny it idk, but like I don't think it's good for myself to stick around. You'll probably never fucking see this, oh you should not see this fucking hell I don't wanna tell u any of these bc I'll hurt you? My ass i wanna do it just so i could grab your attention but i would feel so fucking bad if u get hurt and leave oh wait you already claim I did hurt you. Why should I even think about it when u didn't think about it last year when u ran away, how did he not remind you of me, Rish? Anyways fuck you. Fuck you Mehrish ughhh fuck why do u have to be hot too you asshole, i lowkey wanna stay so you'd send me nudes whenever you get horny lmao man that so fucking shitty ik but ig i just like the attention and I like feeling excusive, and it just turns me on ig. Ukw Rish, i didn't miss you back when you were with Arjun, well at the start i did, then I started to get over you I feel i can do that all over again. We had something beautiful Rish and u ruined it. Don't even fucking tell me I did smtg wrong when we could have worked thru it you just didn't think we worth it, yes it will sound so losery and pathetic that oh i think something over the internet is meaningful oh then fucking call me a loser for thinking we had something significant Rish, 
        it fucking hurted then to see you with another guy but it just hurts me more to see you treat me like shit now, if u think I'm being unreasonable, it's not just bc you reply back to me late, why the fuck do u always think it's about that ughh it's so much more than that you dumb fucking dinosaur wow i don't even wanna call u smtg mean lmao. I wish  at least you don't call me a loser when I tell you I love you yeah sure you're joking haha really hilarious maybe I'm stupid for expecting for smtg more from you now i mean we're frds right lmao, yeah frds don't send me boob pics and ask me to see if they're bigger than last yr's. fuck why am I so driven towards it, why would I even think that's a sign of hope, you're such a fucking ughhh . I wanna say more but i feel like I need to just stop thinking about you for now and crying about some shit that you don't even remember anymore, I feel so embarrassed that I'm actually even caring about all this, but you on the other hand lmao ughhhh fuck you Rish. Idc even if this makes me look stupid, weak or desperate i just wanted to get it off my chest
